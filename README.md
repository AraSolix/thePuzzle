# FYI

- Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Redux, SCSS
- Passwords: LEVEL 1 = JustWarmingUp / LEVEL 2 = DefinitelyWarm 
- Limitations: 
  - The game implements helper to solve the puzzle. 
  - The UI is designed for 3 levels, you can add other levels in CONSTANTS/PIPES.TS file, but in this case there is no guarantee against interface freeze.
